# README

This is an instructional repo for building a server with the node http module. We will use this to practice the basics but will then move on to the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/). Express is more robust than the HTTP module but is built using the HTTP module. A basic understanding will help you identify what's going on under the hood when you write server side code.

## Stages of Demo

### 1. Serve text content

- add the http module to a javascript file
- set it to serve content on a port (we'll use 3000)
- serve a string of text

### 2. Serve multiple routes

- create another route called /api/numbers
- serve an array of numbers
